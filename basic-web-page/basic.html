    <h3><strong>The Freedom Dividend</strong></h3>
    <p>
      <em>Andrew</em> would implement the Freedom Dividend, a universal basic income of $1,000/month, $12,000 a year, for every American adult over the age of 18. This is independent of one’s work status or any other factor. This would enable all Americans to pay their bills, educate themselves, start businesses, be more creative, stay healthy, relocate for work, spend time with their children, take care of loved ones, and have a real stake in the future.<br/>
      Other than regular increases to keep up the cost of living, any change to the Freedom Dividend would require a constitutional amendment.<br/>
      It will be illegal to lend or borrow against one’s Dividend.<br/>
      A Universal Basic Income at this level would permanently grow the economy by 12.56 to 13.10 percent—or about $2.5 trillion by 2025—and it would increase the labor force by 4.5 to 4.7 million people.  Putting money into people’s hands and keeping it there would be a perpetual boost and support to job growth and the economy.
